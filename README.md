### Abstract
The main streams of human activity recognition (HAR) algorithms are developed based on RGB cameras which are suffered from illumination, fast motion, privacy-preserving, and large energy consumption. Meanwhile, the biologically inspired event cameras attracted great interest due to their unique features, such as high dynamic range, dense temporal but sparse spatial resolution, low latency, low power, etc. As it is a newly arising sensor, even there is no realistic large-scale dataset for HAR. Considering its great practical value, in this paper, we propose a large-scale benchmark dataset to bridge this gap, termed HARDVS, which contains 300 categories and more than 100K event sequences. We evaluate and report the performance of multiple popular HAR algorithms, which provide extensive baselines for future works to compare. More importantly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal feature learning and fusion framework, termed ESTF, for event stream based human activity recognition. It first projects the event streams into spatial and temporal embeddings using StemNet, then, encodes and fuses the dual-view representations using Transformer networks. Finally, the dual features are concatenated and fed into a classification head for activity prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our model.

### Our Proposed Approach 
<img src="https://github.com/Event-AHU/HARDVS/blob/main/figures/spatialtempHAR.jpg" width="800px" align="center"> 

**An overview of our proposed ESTF framework for event-based human action recognition.** It transforms the event streams into spatial and temporal tokens and learns the dual features using multi-head self-attention layers. Further, a FusionFormer is proposed to realize message passing between the spatial and temporal features. The aggregated features are added with dual features as the input for subsequent TF and SF blocks, respectively. The outputs will be concatenated and fed into MLP layers for action prediction.
